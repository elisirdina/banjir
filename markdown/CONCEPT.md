- Total number of active evacuation centers (PPS)
- Total number of evacuees
- Total number of affected families
- Last updated timestamp for data freshness

### 2. Interactive Visualizations

#### Bar Chart: Evacuees by District
- Visual representation of evacuee distribution
- Interactive tooltips showing detailed numbers
- Color-coded bars for easy comparison
- Responsive design that adapts to screen size

#### Pie Chart: PPS Distribution
- Shows proportion of evacuation centers by district
- Interactive segments with hover information
- Clear color differentiation between districts

### 3. Detailed Data Table
- Comprehensive view of all districts
- Sortable columns for different metrics
- Searchable entries for quick access
- Responsive design for mobile viewing

### 4. User Interface Features
- Dark/Light mode toggle for different viewing conditions
